    "## Part 1: LangGraph - Building Cyclic Applications with LangChain\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a tool that leverages LangChain Expression Language to build coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications that includes cyclic behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Cycles?\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

    "`coordinated multi-actor and stateful applications`\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does that \"stateful\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "To put it simply - we want to have some kind of object which we can pass around our application that holds information about what the current situation (state) is. Since our system will be constructed of many parts moving in a coordinated fashion - we want to be able to ensure we have some commonly understood idea of that state.\n",

    "Let's think about a simple example to help understand exactly what this means (we'll simplify a great deal to try and clearly communicate what state is doing):\n",

    "  - `{\"messages\" : [HumanMessage(#1), AgentMessage(#1, ...)]}`\n",
